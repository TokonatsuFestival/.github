# Tokonatsu's GitHub Organisation

If you are here and reading this, welcome!

Tokonatsu is an all-ages Japanese Culture Festival, based in the UK. As an outdoor event we don't have a lot of technology to work with, but we do try and keep key bits as open as possible. This organisation has been set up to share our knowledge as much as possible. You will see different code bases from our [Wish Trees App](https://github.com/TokonatsuFestival/WishTreeApplication) through to our [Safeguarding Policies](https://github.com/TokonatsuFestival/safeguarding-policy).

Feel free to reach out to us if there is anything you need!
